Introduction to Machine Learning


What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning: What's the challenge?
Acquainting yourself with the data
What is, what isn't?

Basic prediction model
Classification, Regression, Clustering
Classification, regression or clustering?
Classification: Filtering spam
Regression: LinkedIn views for the next 3 days
Clustering: Separating the iris species
Supervised vs. Unsupervised
Getting practical with supervised learning

Tell the difference

Performance measures
Measuring model performance or error
The Confusion Matrix
Deriving ratios from the Confusion Matrix
The quality of a regression
Adding complexity to increase quality
Let's do some clustering!
What to do with all these performance measures?
Training set and test set
Split the sets
First you train, then you test
Using Cross Validation
How many folds?
Bias and Variance
Overfitting the spam!
Increasing the bias
Interpretability

Classification
Decision trees
Learn a decision tree
Understanding the tree plot
Classify with the decision tree
Pruning the tree
Interpreting the tree
Splitting criterion
k-Nearest Neighbors
Preprocess the data
The knn() function
K's choice
Interpreting a Voronoi diagram
The ROC curve
Creating the ROC curve (1)
Creating the ROC curve (2)
The area under the curve
Interpreting the curves
Comparing the methods

Regression
Regression: simple and linear!
Simple linear regression: your first step!
Performance measure: RMSE
Performance measures: R-squared
Another take at regression: be critical
Non-linear, but still linear?
Interpreting R-squared
Multivariable Linear Regression
Going all-in with predictors!
Are all predictors relevant?
Are all predictors relevant? Take 2!
Interpreting the residuals and p-values
k-Nearest Neighbors and Generalization
Does your model generalize?
Your own k-NN algorithm!
Parametric vs non-parametric!

Clustering
Clustering with k-means
k-means: how well did you do earlier?
The influence of starting centroids
Making a scree plot!
What is your optimal k?
Performance and scaling issues
When to standardize your data?
Standardized vs non-standardized clustering (1)
Standardized vs non-standardized clustering (2)
Hierarchical Clustering
Did you get it all?
Single Hierarchical Clustering
Complete Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical vs k-means
Interpreting Dunn's Index
Clustering US states based on criminal activity
